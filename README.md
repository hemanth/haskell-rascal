> Learning Haskell with a rascal!

__What the hell is haskell-rascal?__

First of all, let me define rascal:

> a mischievous or cheeky person, especially a child or man (typically used in an affectionate way). "a lovable rascal"

Ok, now that you know what rascal means, let learn some haskell?

>Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.

__"The best way to learn is to teach" -- Frank Oppenheirmer__


This repo will remains W.I.P as a rascal learns haskell by teaching it!


__Installation:__

Easy way is to hit [hakell-platfrom](http://www.haskell.org/platform/), download the required binary, install it! 

P.S: If want to build from source paw [here](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/GettingTheSources)

__CLI FTW:__

```sh
$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude> :set prompt "haskell-rascal> "
haskell-rascal> 
```

Now you are all set to do some haskell with a rascal!
